Here is how you can start the app on your local server :

cd to api , install node dependencies using "npm i", then run "tsc" , and then run "node dist/index.js"
this will launch and start your database.
then open a new terminal, cd to frontend install "npm i", run "npm run dev"
this will launch your frontend local server on http://localhost:3000
so visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

here are some screenshots of the app UI :
